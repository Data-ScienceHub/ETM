# Engagement Time Machine

### Project Overview
Our work aims to make human knowledge more interconnected and accessible. Our task is to create a user retention model, which finds patterns in user events to identify user churn risk and predict resubscription behavior. To accomplish this, we will build an RNN to analyze the user event sequences on the platform. We will use first-party customer data, which will include significant user events and actions collected by the client. While our data is already largely clean, our group will engineer the data to effectively prepare it for model use. Data will be hosted on Snowflake, using Python integration through Snowpark API. Machine Learning models will run on AWS SageMaker.
