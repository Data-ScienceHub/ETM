# Engaging Time Machine

### Project Overview
Our work aims to make human knowledge more interconnected and accessible. At the client side, we will create a user retention model, which identifies users with high churn risk and recommend ways to re-engage. The reviewer recommendations model will enable assessing the qualifications of candidate reviewers, followed by providing suggestions to editors. We will use first-party customer data, which include significant user events and actions stored on the platform. There is user profile information. The project will be built on cloud-based platforms. Data will be hosted on Snowflake, using Python integration through Snowpark API. Machine Learning models will run on AWS SageMaker.
